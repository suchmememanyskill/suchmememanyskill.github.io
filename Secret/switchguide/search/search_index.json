Discord Help For live support with this guide please visit us in #switch-assistance on Nintendo Homebrew Discord . What is homebrew? Homebrew applications are custom, user-made software, which haven\u2019t been authorised by Nintendo. This can include save editing tools, games, emulators, and more. Homebrew can be run for free on your Switch as long as you have a \"first-generation\" system running 8.1.0 or lower, and a USB-C cable. What is Custom Firmware? Custom Firmware (\u201cCFW\u201d) enables you to use more advanced hacks that userland homebrew can\u2019t easily do. For instance, installing game modifications with ease. CFW can be set up on any first-generation console on any version (but will require additional tools). What does this guide install? This guide has the end goal of taking a completely unmodified Switch from Stock Firmware to Atmosphere Custom Firmware. fusee-gelee is currently the best method of launching Custom Firmware that gives us nearly full control of the system. It utilizes a vulnerability in the bootROM of the first-generation Switch systems, allowing us to send any payload we want to the Switch's recovery mode, instead of only ones that Nintendo have authorized. What can I do with Custom Firmware? Customize your HOME Menu with user-created themes and splash screens Use \u201cROM hacks\u201d for games that you own Backup, edit, and restore saves for many games Play games for older systems with various emulators, using RetroArch or other standalone emulators Safely update to the latest system version without fear of losing access to homebrew What do I need to know before starting? Before beginning the guide, you must know the risks of Switch hacking: EVERY time you modify your system, there is always the potential for an UNRECOVERABLE brick. They\u2019re rare but still a possibility so make sure you follow ALL directions EXACTLY. This guide will work on first-generation Switch consoles in all regions on firmware 8.1.0 or below. You will need one of the following in order to successfully follow this guide: A USB-A to USB-C cable, and a PC A USB-OTG cable, a USB-A to USB-C cable, and an Android device This does not work on every android phone A USB-C cable, and an Android device with a USB-C port A Lightning to USB-C cable, and a jailbroken iOS device This method is not covered by the guide, but you can read more about it at this website You will also need a micro SD card that is at least 4 gigabytes and preferably 32 gigabytes large or greater, as NAND backups for the console will take up around 30 gigabytes. If everything goes according to plan, you will lose no data and end up with everything that you started with (games, NNID, saves, etc will be preserved). Keep your device plugged in and charged throughout the entire process to avoid data loss or damage from an unexpected power-off.

Currently two hardware revisions of the Switch exist. Any Switch bought before July 2018 has a bootrom bug that allows us to run code regardless of the firmware version on the Switch. When Nintendo updates the system, however, CFW will usually need an update to account for it. This bug cannot be fixed by Nintendo once the console leaves the factory, not even if the console is sent in for repairs. This means that all current and future firmwares will be able to launch CFW through this exploit on the old hardware revision. The first claims of a new hardware revision of the Switch that fixes the exploit needed to launch CFW have been made in July 2018. Currently the only way to know if your Switch is hackable is by trying to send the payload in RCM. Even with this exploit fixed, any Switch on firmware 7.0.1 and below will be able to launch CFW through other means in the far future. The serial number on the back of the box can possibly tell you which consoles are patched and which aren't. See this GBAtemp thread for an up to date list. How do I use the exploit? To launch CFW through the exploit, the Switch needs to be in \"Recovery Mode\"(RCM). The easiest way to enter RCM is by grounding pin 10 in the right joycon rail and holding VOL+ on boot. Several methods and designs to do this exist, see this page of the guide for more information. Once the Switch is in RCM it needs to be connected to either a computer, phone or dongle to send the exploit and the payload. This procedure needs to happen every time the Switch boots from a completely \"off\" state, otherwise the Switch will boot into the stock firmware. What makes a good jig good? Most people prefer to use 3d-printed jigs to enter RCM. These jigs are made in a way that they slide into the right joycon rail and have a piece of connected wire that then bridges pin 10 and one of the grounded pins on the Switch. A lot of different designs for these jigs exist, but it is important to understand, that these jigs can damage the Switch if they are made in a bad way. Since the wire in the jig is supposed to touch the pads inside the Switch's joycon rail, it is important to use wire that is thin, not rigid and bent/not pointy. Paperclips make for potentially dangerous jigs, as they are made out of a hard material, are rigid and pointy and can easily scratch off the pads inside the Switch. A good jig uses 32Gauge(0.2mm diameter) wire and is bent in a way that the end of the wire does not scratch the pads. Switch Jigs sells jigs we consider \"good\". You can also download and 3d-print your own jig and use the pictures on the website to guide you on how to bend the wire correctly. Is there an easier way to launch CFW? To enter RCM more comfortably a solution called \"AutoRCM\" exists. Once set up, this method will always boot the Switch into RCM, even without a jig or holding any buttons. This works by \"bricking\" the Switch in a controlled manner. The Switch detects that something is wrong and boots into RCM to get repaired. The big downside of this method is, that it is impossible to boot the Switch without a computer, phone or dongle, as it will never boot into stock firmware by itself, and that it requires an SD card with the proper CFW files on it at all times. In addition, if the battery of the Switch is completely drained, the Switch will need to charge to at least 10% in Hekate before launching Atmosphere, otherwise the Switch will refuse to boot due to the low battery. Charging in RCM is not recommended as this is very slow. \"AutoRCM\" can be uninstalled, but it is advised to keep a working NAND and BOOT0/1 backup before using it. Many Android-phones are able to send the exploit to the Switch, making them a perfect portable way to launch CFW. Different designs for portable dongles exist, ranging from Raspberry Pi Zero and Arduino projects to internal dongles, that work completely autonomous. The latter should only be done by advanced users, as it requires soldering onto the Switch mainboard itself. Will we ever be able to launch CFW directly? In the future there will possibly be methods to launch CFW without needing a computer, phone or dongle to send the exploit and payload from. However, the higher the firmware of the Switch the less likely these exploits become. Currently there is little hope for such an exploit on firmware 5.0+. Even on lower firmwares, this exploit will most likely not directly boot you into CFW from a \"off\" state, but require you to launch an exploit on the original firmware to then reboot into CFW. The chances of a persistent, untethered coldboot solution (like on the 3DS and Wii-U) technically exist on firmwares below 3.0.2. Should I update XY FW? If your Switch is one of the new hardware revisions that patched the exploit in RCM and you are on firmware 7.0.1 or lower, you should not update if you want to have CFW in the forseeable future. If your Switch is one of the older hardware revisions and you don't mind having to use jigs/hardmods/AutoRCM and sending the exploit via computer, phone or dongle everytime you want to launch into CFW then it is completely safe to update. If you want the chance to maybe, one day, not have to use a external device, then it is recommended to stay on a FW as low as possible. Beware that this means that you potentially need to wait for a very long time (months to years) for this to happen, if ever. Private exploits to launch CFW are known to exist for firmwares up to 7.0.1. Downgrading on the Switch is possible, but it requires using AutoRCM and a custom bootloader payload to bypass the Switch's several hardware anti-downgrade mechanisms. This will not work on an unpatched system, and is practically useless for most users. On every boot the Switch firmware checks how many e-fuses have been burned and how many e-fuses the Switch expects to be burned. Major updates to the Switch, or updates in which a large vulnerability has been patched, irreversibly burn one of the Switch's 32 \"e-fuses\". If the Switch ever detects that more e-fuses have been burned than expected (meaning a downgrade happened), it will refuse to boot. Replacing e-fuses is not an option. A method to update without burning e-fuses exists, but, like downgrading, it forces you to use AutoRCM and sending the exploit via USB every time, as booting into the stock firmware even once would instantly burn the e-fuse. Note that other anti-downgrade mechanisms exist, making it for example impossible to boot game carts on a firmware below 4.1 if the Switch has ever launched a game on firmware 4.1+. This can only be worked around by completely disabling the game cart slot while on 4.1 or greater, which is similarly impractical for most users. Is it safe to use homebrew? The Switch comes with a lot of telemetry, and has been called a \"telemetry monster\" by several prominent developers. As long as the Switch is connected to the internet, Nintendo gets a report about a lot of different actions and states and has the option to log or act on them. Even if the Switch is offline and connects to the internet at a later point, Nintendo still recieves information about what happened while the Switch was disconnected. To disable some of this telemetry, it is advised to disable the sending of error reports in the System Settings of the Switch. Additionally if you live in the EU you can set the \"do not share\" option on Nintendos Accounts Settings Page to prevent your Switch from sending a lot of telemetry. Nintendo still recieves a lot of information, even with those options disabled. We also cannot know if Nintendo decides to look for something in the logs and ban people in retrospect. They have also shown to expand their telemetry options with every other firmware update. Currently all bans have been for very obvious and intrusive actions, specifically: Developers using their unique Switch data to poke and reverse-engineer Nintendos Server responses People pirating games and using them online People changing their profile pictures to custom pictures People using savegame editors to unlock content that is not available yet and using it online (Splatoon 2) People cheating online in general (Modifying Cart stats in MK8) People installing homebrew NSP files, which Nintendo can pick up on with their telemetry People using unsafe custom firmware (such as ReiNX) that dangerously changes the system version string, creating a massive red flag for Nintendo (Atmosphere safely changes the version string and does not have this problem). Atmosphere stops some, but not all of Nintendo's telemetry, and prevents crash reports from being sent. This means Nintendo can't tell if anything, including homebrew or modded games crashed, and Atmosphere dumps the crash log to the SD card to help homebrew developers. However, Nintendo still receives information about what is being played, and general system report information. Atmosphere is not a silver bullet, and this does not mean that Nintendo won't decide to ban people for harmless homebrew in the future. If you are scared to get banned then don't use homebrew for now. In a future Atmosphere update, we will be able to create a dual-boot (EmuNAND) solution, that allows us to have a clean, online firmware and a seperate offline firmware for homebrew related software. Unbanning on the Switch will be a lot harder than previous Nintendo systems, if not impossible. SX OS Team Xecuter's \"EmuNAND\" is not a proper (or safe) EmuNAND, and Nintendo can pick up on it with their telemetry. What formats can homebrew come in? Homebrew can come in two different formats, namely in nro files and in kip files. nro files are placed in the switch folder on your SD card and can be launched using the Homebrew menu. kip files are placed in the atmosphere/kips folder on your SD card and provide additional services. Homebrew risks Be careful with launching downloaded homebrew! If you don't know the source, it's best not to launch it. Homebrew can potentially damage your system! Atmosphere provides protections against common bricking methods, but these are not guaranteed to always work! What microSD card/format should I use? microSD cards that are 32GB or smaller can be used for homebrew, but are not recommended as these will not permit you to have a full NAND dump and an emuNAND in the future. The recommended microSD card size is 128GB. This will permit you to make a full NAND dump as well as having enough space to run an emuNAND in the future while also having adequate space for homebrew. The recommended filesystem format is FAT32. While the Switch supports exFAT through an additional update from Nintendo, this filesystem is prone to corruption and as a result is not advisable. Fake microSD cards Do not buy microSD cards from sites like eBay. These microSD cards are often fake and do not have the advertised amount of storage and will result in data corruption if used. Consumer grade microSD cards do not exist in capacities over 512GB and any that advertise that they are 512GB or larger are fake. If you suspect your microSD card is fake or damaged, see the instructions here to verify the integrity of your SD card. My homebrew is not showing up on the menu? This is an issue primarily affecting macOS users, but may occur on other devices as well. If you are able to launch the homebrew menu, but you are not seeing some or any of your homebrew, you will need to unset the archive bit with Hekate. Send the Hekate payload to your Switch . Navigate to Tools with the volume buttons and press power to confirm. Navigate to Fix archive bit (except Nintendo folder) with the volume buttons and press power to confirm. Wait a bit, this may take a while. Press any button to continue. Navigate to Fix archive bit (Nintendo folder) with the volume buttons and press power to confirm. Wait a bit, this may take a while. Press any button to continue. Navigate to Back... with the volume buttons and press power to confirm.

Hacking terms The following list is in alphabetical order. 90DNS: DNS that blocks system updates on the Nintendo Switch. Atmosphere: The CFW developed by the Atmosphere-NX organization on GitHub and the one used in this guide. AutoRCM: A method that corrupts parts of your boot0 and boot1, causing the Switch to boot into RCM automatically. Using this requires an additional peripheral (such as a computer, phone, dongle or trinket) to be able to boot your Switch. boot0 and boot1: Two partitions of the Switch NAND. CFW: Short for custom firmware. Custom firmware permits you to completely modify how your Switch works. Deja Vu: An unreleased exploit chain for the Nintendo Switch. The completely unpatched version of this chain will grant access to TrustZone, which effectively means being able to enter CFW. The TrustZone part of this exploit was patched in firmware version 5.0.0 and up, but normal homebrew access can still be gained up to firmware version 6.0.1. DNS: Domain Name System . Basically it's the internets addressbook. If you visit a website, the DNS is what tells you what server the site is hosted on. Dongle: Device you can plug in the charging port of your Switch to automatically send a payload if your Switch is in RCM. Encryption keys: Keys used to encrypt files from the Nintendo Switch. These can be dumped by following the guide here . BIS keys: Specific keys used to decrypt the NAND. fusee-gelee/shoFEL2: Two names for two different implementations of the same exploit. This is an exploit that grants full bootrom access to the Nintendo Switch from the Tegra X1s RCM and permits us to run CFW. This exploit requires an external device and a tiny hardware modification. fusee-gelee is developed by an ex-ReSwitched developer, while shoFEL2 is developed by the failoverfl0w team. This guide uses fusee-gelee. hactool: Software used to decrypt Nintendo Switch files like .XCI and .NSP files. Hekate: A bootloader for the Nintendo Switch. The current guide uses this in combination with essential files from Atmosphere to boot CFW. Homebrew: Unsigned code that can be ran on the Nintendo Switch. Examples of homebrew include save editors, emulators and ports of PC games, but can also include completely original games. To run this code, you need to have an exploit. Homebrew launcher: Software developed by the Switchbrew team that lets you run other Homebrew. Jig: Refers to a piece of hardware that you can put in the Joycon rail to enter RCM. KIP: Short for Kernel Initial Process. These files can be loaded in when the Switch boots in CFW and provide additional functionality. NAND: The internal filesystem used by the Switch. Contains boot0 and boot1, as well as PRODINFO and various other partitions. nx-hbloader: Intermediary program used to load the Homebrew Launcher from CFW developed by Switchbrew. Comes bundled with Atmosphere. PRODINFO: A partition on the NAND of your Switch. This along with boot0 and boot1 is the only part of your Switch that can render it unbootable if improperly modified. Atmosphere backs up this partition on booting and it is included in your NAND backup. ReSwitched: A hacking team that is one of the main developers for Atmosphere. RCM: A shorthand for \"Recovery Mode\". When talking about hacking the Switch, this commonly refers to the Recovery Mode in the Tegra X1 chip that is included in the Nintendo Switch. Can be entered by holding down the Tegra X1 home button. This button is not the same as the home button on the joycons. Ways of pressing this button can be found here . TegraRCMGUI/fusee-interface-gtk: Software used to run the fusee-gelee exploit on the Switch. Tegra X1: A chip made by Nvidia that is used in the Nintendo Switch. Trinket: A tiny chip that is soldered on the Switch motherboard to automatically send a payload if it is in RCM. TrustZone: The highest security level on the Switch. XCI/NSP: Format used to dump games to. XCI is used for gamecard dumps, while NSP is for dumping digital titles. Resources The resources below are for users and developers interested in developing Homebrew or for those that want to get a more technical understanding of the various concepts.

Copy the .nxtheme files to the themes folder on your sd card (It is recommended you put them into their own folders, e.g. /themes/awesome_theme/awesome.nxtheme).. Create the themes folder on the root of your sd card if it does not exist. Boot Switch CFW, launch the Homebrew Menu and launch NXThemes Installer . Your theme files should be listed here. You can install them one by one. Reboot your switch to see the changes.

The most affordable of these require nothing more than common household items, while the most reliable are very cheap ($10). Patched Switch Note that patched units can enter RCM, but it is not possible to send a payload on those systems.

The easiest to immediately accomplish are listed at the top, and the most advanced/difficult methods are at the bottom. Instructions Power off the Switch and use one of the methods listed below to short the pins. Hold Volume Up and press the Power button. If your Switch displays the Nintendo logo and boots normally or immediately shuts down, you didn't successfully enter RCM and should try again. Otherwise, if your console did not turn on normally, and the screen remained black with no backlight, your Switch is in RCM. RCM Jig (Easiest for beginners) Click to expand! Note Some jig designs use paperclips, inheriting the same risks as the Metal Bridge / Paperclip method. If you would like a safe jig design, we highly recommend switchjigs.com . This method is similar to the Metal Bridge / Paperclip method, but is more reliable and safer in many cases. Jigs hold a wire in place so the correct pins (10 and a ground) are shorted every time. Jigs range in price, with the ones we recommend being $5. They're slightly more expensive than some mass produced jigs, however we can guarantee their quality. Also spending $5 on a quality jig using 32-gauge wire is a smaller cost than replacing your entire Joy-Con rail after the pins are scratched off by a paperclip jig. In the case you plan to make you own jig, this image lays out the pads numbers on the console. Make sure your jig NEVER touches pin 4. Pin 4 provides 5v power to the Joycons, if connected to any other pin you will fry the console. Soldered Joy-Con Pads - Physical RCM Button (Safest) Click to expand! Note This method requires opening your right Joy-Con, voiding its warranty. Not for the faint of heart. This method comes to us from the mind of pbanj#9188 on Discord. All pictures of this method in action were provided by him, with some supplementary images provided by eip \u221e#3283 on Discord. The goal of this method is to open the right handed Joy-Con to the point that you can reach the contact pads easily. This is similar to the previous method, however you will be soldering wires to pins 7 and 10 (shown below) and wiring them to the \"Joycon release button\" at the top back of the right hand Joycon. In order to start this method you will want to take two lengths of wire, and wrap one end of each into a small circle. You will then want to take the circular end of one of the wires and add a small amount of solder, keeping it mostly flat (ONLY DO THIS TO ONE OF THE WIRES!). You will then glue this wire down to the below point on the Joycon release button. Make sure glue doesn't cover the top of the solder/wire as it will act as a contact point. Also, ensure that you leave enough space for the button to function correctly. Try pushing the button from the outside and observing its travel path so that you can see where and how you should safely glue the solder glob. The first wire should now be in place as seen by the green circle below. The second wire does not need any solder, instead you will hold it in place using the screw as shown by the red circle in the picture below. Pressing the Joycon button in you should now notice the solder point you created making contact with the piece of metal held in by the screw. Once you have these elements in place you want to connect one wire to pad 7 and the other to pad 10 (it doesn't matter which is which). After that you have successfully created an RCM button on your Joycon. You will now need to hold down the Joycon release button when attempting to boot RCM. Soldered Joy-Con Pads - 7 & 10 Click to expand! Note This method requires opening your right Joy-Con, voiding its warranty. Not for the faint of heart. The goal of this method is to open the right handed Joy-Con to the point that you can reach the contact pads easily. This is similar to the previous method, however the goal is to solder pins 7 and 10 (shown below) together with a surface-mount 0805 10k resistor. Apart from using a physical switch/button, this is currently considered the safest method that involves soldering to pads. Here is an example from stuckpixel#3421 on the ReSwitched Discord server. Soldered Joy-Con Pads - 9 & 10 Click to expand! Note This method will result in the right Joy-Con being detected as in wireless mode while attached to the Switch, and this method may result in the Joy-Con being permanently detected as wireless if you update the Joy-Con firmware while this mod is installed. In the latter case, fixing this requires opening up the Joy-Con and reseating the battery. It is recommended to solder pads 7 and 10 together with a resistor instead. Note This method requires opening your right Joy-Con, voiding its warranty. Not for the faint of heart. The goal of this method is to open the right handed Joy-Con to the point that you can reach the contact pads easily. This is similar to the previous method, however the goal is to solder pads 9 and 10 (seen below) together. This can either be done using a small wire, or directly bridging the pads with solder. Here is an example from YyAoMmIi#3705 on our Discord server. Bent Joy-Con Pins (Not recommended) Click to expand!

Fortunately, due to the fusee-gelee vulnerability, this special mode acts as our gateway into CFW. There are several methods of entering RCM ( R e C overy M ode). The most affordable of these require nothing more than common household items, while the most reliable are very cheap ($10). Patched Switch Note that patched units can enter RCM, but it is not possible to send a payload on those systems. Also note that RCM is a different recovery mode than the one accessed by holding Volume Up, Volume Down, and Power. Note The order of methods on this page is in the order of ease. The easiest to immediately accomplish are listed at the top, and the most advanced/difficult methods are at the bottom. Instructions Power off the Switch and use one of the methods listed below to short the pins. Hold Volume Up and press the Power button. If your Switch displays the Nintendo logo and boots normally or immediately shuts down, you didn't successfully enter RCM and should try again. Otherwise, if your console did not turn on normally, and the screen remained black with no backlight, your Switch is in RCM. RCM Jig (Easiest for beginners) Click to expand! Note Some jig designs use paperclips, inheriting the same risks as the Metal Bridge / Paperclip method. If you would like a safe jig design, we highly recommend switchjigs.com . This method is similar to the Metal Bridge / Paperclip method, but is more reliable and safer in many cases. Jigs hold a wire in place so the correct pins (10 and a ground) are shorted every time. Jigs range in price, with the ones we recommend being $5. They're slightly more expensive than some mass produced jigs, however we can guarantee their quality. Also spending $5 on a quality jig using 32-gauge wire is a smaller cost than replacing your entire Joy-Con rail after the pins are scratched off by a paperclip jig. In the case you plan to make you own jig, this image lays out the pads numbers on the console. Make sure your jig NEVER touches pin 4. Pin 4 provides 5v power to the Joycons, if connected to any other pin you will fry the console. Soldered Joy-Con Pads - Physical RCM Button (Safest) Click to expand! Note This method requires opening your right Joy-Con, voiding its warranty. Not for the faint of heart. This method comes to us from the mind of pbanj#9188 on Discord. All pictures of this method in action were provided by him, with some supplementary images provided by eip \u221e#3283 on Discord. The goal of this method is to open the right handed Joy-Con to the point that you can reach the contact pads easily. This is similar to the previous method, however you will be soldering wires to pins 7 and 10 (shown below) and wiring them to the \"Joycon release button\" at the top back of the right hand Joycon. In order to start this method you will want to take two lengths of wire, and wrap one end of each into a small circle. You will then want to take the circular end of one of the wires and add a small amount of solder, keeping it mostly flat (ONLY DO THIS TO ONE OF THE WIRES!). You will then glue this wire down to the below point on the Joycon release button. Make sure glue doesn't cover the top of the solder/wire as it will act as a contact point. Also, ensure that you leave enough space for the button to function correctly. Try pushing the button from the outside and observing its travel path so that you can see where and how you should safely glue the solder glob. The first wire should now be in place as seen by the green circle below. The second wire does not need any solder, instead you will hold it in place using the screw as shown by the red circle in the picture below. Pressing the Joycon button in you should now notice the solder point you created making contact with the piece of metal held in by the screw. Once you have these elements in place you want to connect one wire to pad 7 and the other to pad 10 (it doesn't matter which is which). After that you have successfully created an RCM button on your Joycon. You will now need to hold down the Joycon release button when attempting to boot RCM. Soldered Joy-Con Pads - 7 & 10 Click to expand! Note This method requires opening your right Joy-Con, voiding its warranty. Not for the faint of heart. The goal of this method is to open the right handed Joy-Con to the point that you can reach the contact pads easily. This is similar to the previous method, however the goal is to solder pins 7 and 10 (shown below) together with a surface-mount 0805 10k resistor. Apart from using a physical switch/button, this is currently considered the safest method that involves soldering to pads. Here is an example from stuckpixel#3421 on the ReSwitched Discord server. Soldered Joy-Con Pads - 9 & 10 Click to expand!

The most affordable of these require nothing more than common household items, while the most reliable are very cheap ($10). Patched Switch Note that patched units can enter RCM, but it is not possible to send a payload on those systems.

Note Some jig designs use paperclips, inheriting the same risks as the Metal Bridge / Paperclip method. If you would like a safe jig design, we highly recommend switchjigs.com . This method is similar to the Metal Bridge / Paperclip method, but is more reliable and safer in many cases. Jigs hold a wire in place so the correct pins (10 and a ground) are shorted every time. Jigs range in price, with the ones we recommend being $5. They're slightly more expensive than some mass produced jigs, however we can guarantee their quality. Also spending $5 on a quality jig using 32-gauge wire is a smaller cost than replacing your entire Joy-Con rail after the pins are scratched off by a paperclip jig. In the case you plan to make you own jig, this image lays out the pads numbers on the console. Make sure your jig NEVER touches pin 4. Pin 4 provides 5v power to the Joycons, if connected to any other pin you will fry the console.","title":"RCM Jig (Easiest for beginners)"},{"location":"user_guide/sysnand/entering_rcm/#soldered-joy-con-pads-physical-rcm-button-safest","text":"Click to expand! Note This method requires opening your right Joy-Con, voiding its warranty. Not for the faint of heart. This method comes to us from the mind of pbanj#9188 on Discord. All pictures of this method in action were provided by him, with some supplementary images provided by eip \u221e#3283 on Discord. The goal of this method is to open the right handed Joy-Con to the point that you can reach the contact pads easily. This is similar to the previous method, however you will be soldering wires to pins 7 and 10 (shown below) and wiring them to the \"Joycon release button\" at the top back of the right hand Joycon. In order to start this method you will want to take two lengths of wire, and wrap one end of each into a small circle. You will then want to take the circular end of one of the wires and add a small amount of solder, keeping it mostly flat (ONLY DO THIS TO ONE OF THE WIRES!). You will then glue this wire down to the below point on the Joycon release button. Make sure glue doesn't cover the top of the solder/wire as it will act as a contact point. Also, ensure that you leave enough space for the button to function correctly. Try pushing the button from the outside and observing its travel path so that you can see where and how you should safely glue the solder glob. The first wire should now be in place as seen by the green circle below. The second wire does not need any solder, instead you will hold it in place using the screw as shown by the red circle in the picture below. Pressing the Joycon button in you should now notice the solder point you created making contact with the piece of metal held in by the screw. Once you have these elements in place you want to connect one wire to pad 7 and the other to pad 10 (it doesn't matter which is which). After that you have successfully created an RCM button on your Joycon. You will now need to hold down the Joycon release button when attempting to boot RCM.","title":"Soldered Joy-Con Pads - Physical RCM Button (Safest)"},{"location":"user_guide/sysnand/entering_rcm/#soldered-joy-con-pads-7-10","text":"Click to expand!
