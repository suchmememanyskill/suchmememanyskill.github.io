Boot into hekate and make a boot0/1 and raw gpp backup, you can see the full instructions on how to do this here Copy these backups to your PC.

Open it, and then go to the top right corner and click the correct stoarge device Create 2 partitions, the last one needs to be 29.3GB in size, the first partition can be filled with the rest of the space available. Please make sure both partitions are FAT32 Part 3: The Flashing Open a terminal and type lsblk Locate your SD card in the list of storage devices Now we are going to use dd to flash your emunand to the second partition To flash with dd do the following first: Locate the path to your emunand backup (the file called emummc.bin ) this will be your if , or Input File If the path to your emunand contains a space you would add a \\ to indicate a space, ex if=/home/ubuntu/My\\ Folder/emummc.bin alternitivly you may put that folder name in quotes.

Right click on the partition that you flashed your emunand to and select Information You should see the following: Grab the first sector number and run it through a deciamal to hex converter, one can be found here . You will need the hex value later Part 5: Setup ini Create a folder on the root of the sd card that YOU DID NOT flash your emunand to called emummc Create a file in the emummc folder called emummc.ini . Put the following into that ini: [emummc] emummc_enabled = 1 emummc_sector = 0x(hex offset) The hex offset is the hex value you obtained in part 4. this is at most 8 hex characters Replace \"(hex offset)\" with your obtained hex offset Now if you boot fusee-primary.bin, you'll instead boot into emunand.
